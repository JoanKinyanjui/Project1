     <h6 className='Safety2'>Your health and safety are our absolute priority at this time,
         so to protect you and your beauty professional we have <br />introduced enhanced hygiene and safety
         protocols for all at home beauty services. You can now relax knowing that your <br />Home Spur vetted and
         tested beauty professional will look after you in the safest way possible.
          Our artists will wear a mask if <br />asked or required.
         Clients, of course, cannot wear a mask when having their makeup services
         performed and may not be able<br /> to wear a mask for some hairstyles.
         Once entering your homes,
         we will immediately escort you to wash your hands. <br />After every service, our staff takes extra time to
         thoroughly sanitize the bridal trial rooms and all implements used during the <br />service.
         <br /><br /><br />
         KEEP SAFE!!
